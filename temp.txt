learned: 
- using math.random and floor
- passing second argument as a callback function and not immediately.
ie, addEventListener("click", function) is wrong. should be ("Click", () => function);
- intervalID, setInterval, setTimeout

to add:
- loop again if user wants to play again (best of N rounds or exit at any time)
- against two players
- color
