learned: 
- using math.random and floor


to add:
- error handling for invalid input for human choice.
- loop again if user wants to play again (best of N rounds or exit at any time)
- against two players

- passing second argument as a callback function and not immediately.
ie, addEventListener("click", function) is wrong. should be ("Click", () => function);
